# Repository for RNN Models to predict H1 and H2

This repository contains the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models trained to predict the parameters H1 and H2 proposed by Ishihara in 1985. 
Additionally, it includes the synthetic datasets used for training these models, as defined in the article:

**"A Generator of Synthetic Liquefaction Safety Factor Profiles for Training Machine Learning Models"**


## Repository Contents

- **Trained RNN Models**: Models designed for predicting H1 and H2 parameters.
- **Synthetic Data**: Datasets generated for training the models, aligned with the methodology presented in the article.

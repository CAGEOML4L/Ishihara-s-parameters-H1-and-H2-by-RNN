# Repository for RNN Models to predict H1 and H2

This repository contains Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models trained to predict the parameters H1 and H2 proposed by Ishihara in 1985, according to the methodology presented in the article: **"A Generator of Synthetic Liquefaction Safety Factor Profiles for Training Machine Learning Models"**. Additionally, it includes both the trained models and the datasets used for training and validation.

## Repository Contents

- **Trained RNN Models**: Models designed for predicting H1 and H2 parameters.
- **synthetic_data_10000.csv** generated data for training the models, aligned with the methodology presented in the article.
- **Liquefaction.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the final implementation and analysis.
- **rea_data.csv**: Dataset containing real data used for validation.
